# Local backend configuration
# Uncomment this block to use the local backend
# Remember to run terraform init after changing backend configuration

/*
terraform {
  backend "local" {
    path = "terraform/state/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
*/

# When using this backend, state is stored on your local filesystem
# This is the default behavior if no backend is specified
# Benefits:
# - Simple to use
# - No additional configuration required
# - Easy to understand

# Limitations:
# - Not suitable for team environments
# - No remote state locking
# - Risk of state file loss if local system fails
