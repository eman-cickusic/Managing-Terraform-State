# Google Cloud Storage backend configuration
# Uncomment this block to use the GCS backend
# Remember to run terraform init -migrate-state after changing backend configuration

/*
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket  = "your-project-id-tf-state"  # Replace with your bucket name
    prefix  = "terraform/state"
  }

# When using this backend, state is stored in Google Cloud Storage
# Benefits:
# - State is stored remotely and can be shared between team members
# - Supports state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
# - More secure than storing state locally
# - Built-in versioning for state files
# - Better for team environments

# Limitations:
# - Requires setting up a Google Cloud Storage bucket
# - Potential costs for storage and operations
# - Requires GCP credentials
